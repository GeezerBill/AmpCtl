# AmpCtl
This is a desktop program to control a Hardrock 50 amplifier using the USB port on the amplifier. This enables complete control from the computer, without having to physically adjust the transceiver or the amplifier. I am using hamlib for transceiver control through my logging program and for transceiver control for digital modes.
Once connected to the amplifier, controls on the page initiate band changes, keying mode selection, and operating mode. Amplifier operating status is displayed after each transmit cycle. as well. 
My developmant system (also my workhorse station computer) is an HP EliteBook G1 running Ubuntu Linux 18.04 LTS. I am running the default Gnome desktop. I installed Lazarus 2.08 fom the Lazarus site. To complete the build environment, you will need the TLazSerial library, as well its' dependencies.
This is version 0.2, and just barely qualifies as beta software. I do not believe it has the potential to cause anything but annoyances on your system. YMMV. If you do decide to improve it, please feel free. If you have suggestions or advice as to how to best address the items in the TO-DO list, please forward them to bill@n5bia.net.
